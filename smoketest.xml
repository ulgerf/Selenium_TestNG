        TestNG is used for creating customized test execution xml files
        We can run this xml file when we want to execute our smoke test
        In my smoke test there are around 12 test classes
        It takes about 15 mins to complete the test execution
        -login test with different profiles(admin, manager, customer service, end user)
        -a few end to end testings: reservation with correct profiles, add payment, and checkout
        -I run smoke test every morning and share the report with the team
